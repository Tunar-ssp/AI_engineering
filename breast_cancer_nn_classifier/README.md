breast cancer nn classifier

this is a simple project for learning about neural networks and breast cancer data

how to start

- make sure you have python installed
- install the needed libraries from requirements.txt
- open notebook.ipynb in your favorite notebook tool
- follow the steps in the notebook

what you will find

- a neural network built from scratch or with a library
- steps for loading and looking at the data
- training and testing the model
- some notes about results and what they mean

why this is here

- for learning and practice
- to show how a simple neural network can help with real data
